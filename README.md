# MotionPush
Creating a camera oriented way to add, commit, and push your work through hand signals

run the `Motion_Detection.py` to check out the AI we built! :D

## Update
The commit functionality does not work anymore because it relied on the 1 year assemblyAI key we got while doing the hackathon. We used the key to make it so you can speak the commit message you want, but now it will not send a message and only get back an error because the key is depricated.
